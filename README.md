Free Code Camp Weather Application
----------------------------------
A basic weather application which uses an API to show the current conditions and temp

This is a simple app which uses the Weather Underground API to display the current weather.  It was origionally built using the Open Weather Map API but that proved incompatible when the application was put on CodePen for sharing.  CodePen runs off of HTTPS and the Weather Map API only exposes an HTTP endpoint on free accounts, thus the switch to the more flexable API.  Application can be [viewed and used here](https://codepen.io/cugamer/full/vyvmRO/ "Free Code Camp Weather Application").

Developed in Sublime Text and CodePen using the following systems
* jQuery
* jQuery Date Format
* Google Maps API
* Weather Underground API
